Once there was a Fox and a stork. The Fox was selfish but he decided to invite the stork for dinner. The Stork was extremely happy to be invited and she reached his house on time.

The Fox opened the door and invited her in. They sat on the table; The Fox served her some soup in shallow bowls. While the fox licked up his soup, the Stork couldn't drink it because she has a long beak and the bowl was too shallow.

The next day, the Stork invited the fox over for dinner. She Served him soup as well but in two narrow vases. While the Stork enjoyed her soup and finished it, the fox went home very hungry realizing his mistake.
